<h1>Candidate Tracker Instructions </h1>
       
<hr>    
<p> The purpose of this system is to keep track of job candidates: their contact
information, their status and next action, any associated documents such
as resumes, interview schedules, and comments. From the home page of the
Tracker, you can add new candidates to the system, search for existing candidates,
and, if authorized, add and change information about candidates.  </p>
       
<h2>Candidate Lifecycle</h2>
     
<p>Each candidate goes through a lifecycle, represented in the Tracker by 
 the "Next Action" value associated with each job candidate. &nbsp;The description 
 and order of the next-action values is entirely configurable and by default 
 is as follows, in order of occurence in the lifecycle:<br>
   </p>
     
<table cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" border="1">
      <tbody>
   <tr>
   <td valign="middle">none</td>
   <td>No next action is planned or is intended to be planned. &nbsp;This 
is functionally equivalent to "no value" which is represented as the string
 "-- NONE --" in wherever the next action items appears in the user interface.<br>
        </td>
   </tr>
     <tr>
  <td nowrap="true">preliminary phone screen</td>
  <td>The next action is for HR or the recruiter to telephone the candidate 
to determine if he is still available, interested, and able to work in the 
USA.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>functional resume review</td>
  <td>The next step is for someone in the hiring department to read the candidate's 
resume to assess whether or not the candidate is qualified for the position. 
      <br>
       </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>hold</td>
  <td>There is no next step planned, but some new "next action" will be assigned 
to this candidate in the near future.<br>
       </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>technical phone screen</td>
  <td>The next action is for someone in the hiring department to telephone 
the candidate to assess if an on-site interview is warranted.<br>
       </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>schedule first round</td>
  <td>Having determined that the candidate warrants an on-site interview,

the next action is to schedule it.<br>
       </td>
