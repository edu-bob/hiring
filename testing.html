<p> Follow these instructions to test the candidate tracker. </p>
   
<h3>Set up</h3>
   
<ol>
  <li><b>Clear out the database.</b> Run <code>sh maintenance/empty-db.sh</code>
  to clear all of the data out of the hiring database. This also creates
a dump of all of the data in the database into a file called "create-full.sql".
 It also creates an initial user, Bob Brown, with administrative priviledges.
