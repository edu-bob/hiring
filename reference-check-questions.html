  <font face="Arial">Dear PERSON</font><font face="Arial">,</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">&nbsp;
  CANDIDATES-NAME has applied for a developer position in my group,
  and has gone through two rounds of interviews here.&nbsp; I would like the
  opportunity to ask you a few questions concerning HIM/HER.&nbsp; We can do
  this via e-mail or on the phone.&nbsp; If the latter, please write back and
  recommend a couple of time slots during which I could call you, and where.&nbsp;
  The questions I would ask on a phone check would be these:</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">1. How long have you known
  CANDIDATES-FIRST-NAME and in what capacities?</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">2.&nbsp;How would you
  characterize HIS/HER technical competence and ability to work in a group?</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">3. If you had the
  opportunity to recommend, anonymously, to CANDIDATES-FIRST-NAME one area for
  improvement, what would it be?</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">4. Of all of the people
  you have worked with over the years who are in the same discipline as
  CANDIDATES-FIRST-NAME, where would you rank HIM/HER, using percentiles?</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">5. Would you hire HIM/HER,
  or work with HIM/HER again, if you had the opportunity, and how strong is that
  desire?</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">6. Is there anything else
  you would want a manager considering to hire CANDIDATES-FIRST-NAME to know?</font>
</p>
<p><font face="Arial">
  7. Can you recommend someone else that we
  might talk with to help us assure that CANDIDATES-FIRST-NAME will be
  successful at Education.com?</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">Thank you.&nbsp; Feel free to
  answer via-e-mail; your answers will not go into our tracking system and will
  be kept confidential.&nbsp; Again, if you prefer to do this on the telephone,
  please let me know.</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font face="Arial">Warm regards,</font>
